#### I'm a self-taught (more like self-teaching) web developer!

- If you came here from seeing me standing on the street, welcome! I've been self-teaching for 4 months, initially on The Odin Project, but eventually veering to a curriculum that was more personally gratifying. 
- After dabbling with x number of frameworks or stacks, I ultimately landed on the notion that it was foolhardy to try and learn a specific stack, when I might not even end up using said stack at a future job. 
- Instead, I believe that focusing on JS fundamentals, while presenting a willingness to learn with a commit history that says as much, is more likely to be impactful. Thanks for reading!
